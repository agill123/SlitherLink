Question how to convert the coordinates to links to display on the grid

well maybe can convert the links into pairs 
remove the pairs where the numbers are all equal 

in javascript 
if the difference between the pairs is one it is a horizontal link
if it is five 
it is a vertical link

find a way to represent this link then on the grid. 



A horizontal line between two dots will originate at the x and y coordinates of one dot and terminate at the x and y coordinates of the dot next to it 

0	0
1	5
2	2
3	3
4	4

To draw the links:
1.Iterate through the links array in an i,j loop
2.Check if it is horizontal vertical or no link 
3.Place it in the right position
4.
5. 
6.
7.
8.
9.

After the puzzle has been solved the user should not be able to click on the input area any longer. 
There should be error handling for when there is no solution. 

Useful solve screen options
Solve new puzzle, edit and resolve current puzzle
Because some puzzles take a long time to solve there should be a solving indicator to show that the puzzle is solving 



RATIONALE

Because of the process of generation puzzles are stored in the database and updated periodically rather than autogenerating a random puzzle.

BUT MAYBE SHOULD AUTOGENERATE INSTEAD OF GOING THE DATABASE ROUTE??????????????????????
